# Productivity Planner

## About
A CRUD React.js app made using local storage for people to manage their tasks and organise their week. Background image was made by me on Procreate. This app was designed and inspired by Grace Beverley's Productivity Method planners which I am a big fan of!

## How to use
For each task you list, specify the completion date and time as well as the type of task using the to-do table method, which allows you to prioritise, visualise and group tasks before you start your day.

The type of task include:
  - Habit: Something you'll commit to that day to reach your longer term goals
  - Quick tick: Tasks that take 5 mins or less
  - Task: Tasks that will take you up to 30 mins and don't involved more than 2-3 tasks to get the whole task done
  - Project: This will be broken down into tasks which can be completed in time blocks over a period of a week or month
  - Non-negotitable: Choose 3 non-negotiable tasks you will get done that day. Its good to choose just 3 that are related to your yearly, quarterly and monthly goals.

## Purpose
This aim of this project was to get start on learning React.js and become familar with CRUD. I was also able to add a timed popup feature in the app to provide more information about how to use it. This project also taught me about the use of Hooks and the appropriate importation of libraries and files in a React.js app. 

## Challenges
I initially found it quite challenging creating multiple input boxes for the form because that increase the number of validations required for the app, and I needed to ensure that whenever a person would submit a task, the input box reset to an empty string so that only the placeholders were showing for the next task submission.

## Next Steps
In future, I would like to add a filter that allows people to search tasks based on date and type of task. I also want to create a page for each task where people can add more notes and set an alarm to remind them of the deadline.
